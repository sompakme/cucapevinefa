The promise Aiden had made when he was younger was actually to Waltz in hopes that they could cure Mia. Determined to save his daughter, Waltz wants to run new tests in X13.<h2>Does Aiden find his sister in Dying Light 2?</h2>Aiden needs to go to X13 to confront Waltz and, hopefully, find a cure for the side effects he is having.
