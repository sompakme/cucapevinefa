They first made headlines due to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the notable 16-year age gap between the two</a>. However, it didn‚Äôt take long for their relationship to develop from simply being friends, to possibly starting a family together. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">In light of their most recent breakup</a>, the couple have managed to snag the limelight once more.

Specifically, the Real Housewives Of Miami star and UCF basketball player had met through mutual friends. As a result, they became friends themselves. Pippen is renowned for her appearances on reality television and her ties to the NBA through her ex-husband, Scottie Pippen. Marcus Jordan, on the other hand, is the son of basketball legend <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Michael Jordan</a>. The two were in social circles frequented by the rich and famous, so it‚Äôs no surprise that they crossed paths.

Later that month, the pair were spotted once more at the Rolling Loud music festival in New York. The famous duo opted out of discretion, loving on each other publicly. Naturally, it did not take long for the rumor mill to get going. However, Pippen shut the rumors down the next month in an interview with People Magazine at BravoCon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">‚ÄúWe're friends,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe've been friends for a few years and that's really what it is.

In another conversation with People Magazine, Pippen confessed to when things turned romantic for her. "I think it was one night we went out and there was a girl that was there. She was trying to talk to him, and I was getting jealous over it,‚Äù she admitted. And it was weird because I'm not really the jealous person, but I was jealous over the situation. And so then, I was thinking maybe I do really like him. That kind of sealed the deal.‚Äù</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-february-2023-my-sweet-valentine>February 2023: My Sweet Valentine</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 13: Marcus Jordan and Larsa Pippen are seen on February 13, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

On a later episode of the podcast, they also discussed the possibility of having kids. ‚ÄúThere's been conversations around having kids,‚Äù Jordan shared. "When we go and we meet people, or I'm introducing you to some of my friends, or you introduce me to some of your friends I feel like it gets brought up.

Pippen had also posted a cryptic message on her Instagram Story, insinuating that they had called it quits. Confirmation of their split came from a source speaking to People Magazine, explaining: "They have decided to take some time apart to reevaluate their relationship. This decision stems from their desire for personal growth and is not influenced by external factors, including family." However, the couple's separation appeared short-lived when they <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">were spotted together again</a>, seemingly reconciled, and just in time for Valentine's Day.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-march-2024-done-for-good>March 2024: Done for Good?</h2></span><p>PARIS, FRANCE - JANUARY 22: Marcus Jordan and Larsa Pippen are seen together after a shopping at Hermes store on January 22, 2024 in Paris, France.
