The marriage didn’t last long, however, and Clarke was promptly on the prowl by seducing and bedding none other than Sloan's ex-fiance, E. In real life, Clarke has 1 child with husband <strong>Ernie Mirich</strong>, from whom she is now separated.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Gary Busey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Entouragegarysdeskreview20070806115833021_a_l.jpg><p>Making a series of bizarre cameos, <strong>Gary Busey</strong> first appeared during Season 1 in a hilarious and improvised beach scene in which he gives Turtle a few cryptic words of wisdom. Busey appeared twice again on the show, once in the Season 2 premiere and again during Season 4.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7><h2>Professional Athletes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/basketball_a_l.jpg><p>Athletes across all professional fields have gladly stepped up for their cameos on the hit HBO series. Among them –<strong> Lamar Odom, Chuck Liddell, Phil Mickelson, Michael Phelps, Derek Jeter, Kobe Bryant, Alex Rodriguez</strong> and perhaps most notably, <strong>Tom Brady</strong>. The Pats QB landed himself on the receiving end of some serious New York hate in Season 6, Episode 5 when Turtle delivered the line “I’m gonna tell him he sucks balls.”</p><p>New York Yankee <strong>Mark Texiera</strong>, who appears in Season 8, said during an HBO special, “I don’t know a single athlete who doesn’t watch Entourage. Every athlete wishes he could be that actor living the life in Hollywood.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Seth Green</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/109818567_a_p.jpg><p><strong>Seth Green</strong> popped up during three seperate episodes, in which he and Eric butt heads over Sloan. Green is portrayed as a stalker, whose influence over the couple's relationship lingers long into the eighth season, with several remakes being made at his expense, though Sloan continues to deny any involvement with the actor. When the crews face an uncomfortable run-in in Las Vegas, Green tells E, "I must have been dreaming about how I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollack." For that, he receives a swift punch in the face from Drama.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Jaime Pressley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/120383433_a_p.jpg><p>The actress played herself in a small season two arc in which she helped E to re-assert his manhood after his girlfriend Kristen (<strong>Monica Keena</strong>) cheated on him. Pressley hosted a beach bash that the boys attended and at which E met Liana (<strong>Holly Valance</strong>), a Perfect 10 model, whom he later bedded. Pressley and Vince also managed to have a little tryst themselves.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Mark Cuban</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/114500471_a_l.jpg><p>The Dallas Maverick’s owner has become an Entourage staple in the last two seasons. He first appeared on the show in the Season Seven episode “Sniff Sniff Gang Bang,” in which he unexpectedly dropped in on Ari. But, Cuban ended up getting into business with Turtle, becoming an investor in Avion tequila. The sports owner popped up again this season when Turtle decided to pull his investment to fund an LA outpost of his hometown Don Peppe’s restaurant.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Jerry Jones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/107049833_a_p.jpg><p>The notorious Dallas Cowboy’s owner played himself in Season Seven during a storyline that had Ari making a bid to represent the NFL in their television rights deals (which later turned into Ari trying to bring an NFL team to L.A.). Ellin, called Jones, who shot his part over the course of two days, “a real pro in front of the camera.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Mark Wahlberg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/TCDENTOEC024H_a_l.jpg><p><span class=Apple-style-span>Though he’s both a creator and executive producer on the show, which is partially based on his Hollywood experience, Wahlberg has only made four cameos throughout the series’ eight seasons. The first, and probably the most memorable, was the pilot, where he runs into the fab four while walking down the street, Wahlberg ribs Turtle for an unpaid debt and invites Drama to golf during the pass-by scene. Odds are he’ll end the show the way he started it, with one more on-screen appearance.</span><span class=Apple-style-span>&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Bob Sagat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AP050919014683_a_p.jpg><p><span class=Apple-style-span>The Full House star and comedian has played a neurotic version of himself a few times over the course of the show. He first guest-starred in the Second Season, and returned last season (Full House alum <strong>John Stamos</strong> also had a Season Seven spot). In each episode he’s shown as a cocky money-boasting, drug-loving womanizer (and former neighbor of the guys). “There’s really not a thing for me to change,” he said of his on-screen character. “Just put the F-bombs where they belong.”</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Jessica Simpson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/116038006_a_p.jpg><p><span class=Apple-style-span>The singer referenced the real-life loss of her beloved Maltipoo, Daisy, in her cameo, during which Ari and Lloyd show up at her house with a canine replacement in an attempt to keep her as a client. "Daisy was a Maltipoo … that's just a poo," she snipes, slamming the door in his face.</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aaron Sorkin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/115447466_a_p.jpg><p><span class=Apple-style-span>The famously moody screenwriter made two brief cameos on the show. In Season Six he came to Gold-Miller agency to take a meeting with Ari’s now-disgraced super agent Andrew Klein (<strong>Gary Cole</strong>). But, to Sorkin’s dismay, Klein isn’t there because he’s been arrested, so Ari meets with Sorkin instead. “I hate you,” Sorkin says breezily as his greeting to Ari, before traveling with him to continue his meeting with Klein at the county jail. Klein manages to sign Sorkin after pitching him through tears. (He also played himself on 30 Rock in 2011). He reappeared again in 2010 when junior agent Lizzie Grant (<strong>Autumn Reeser</strong>) tries to steal the writer away from Ari.</span><span class=Apple-style-span>&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Mandy Moore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/112748873_a_l.jpg><p><span class=Apple-style-span>In Season Two the actress had a five-episode arc in which she played Vince’s childhood love resurrected. Moore, who had had a serious romance with Vince while co-starring together in A Walk to Remember, that ended after the actor proposed to Moore and she turned him down, was being considered as Vince’s Aquaman love interest. The two meet to see if co-starring again is possible and end up rekindling their romance, though, again, it doesn’t last.</span><span class=Apple-style-span>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=Apple-style-span>&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Kevin Dillon and Andrew Dice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/entourage1117_a_l.jpg><p>Proving to be both a source of support and a heavy burden on Johnny Drama, the previously out-of-work comic signs on to voice one of the characters in Drama’s upcoming cartoon, Johnny Bananas, in a Season 8 multi-episode arc. Tensions rise as Dice demands more money, convincing Drama to put his own involvement in the potentially career-saving project in jeopardy. Going into the series finale, it remains one of the conflicts still unresolved.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Gus Van Sant</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/120076637_a_p.jpg><p><span class=Apple-style-span>The director appeared as himself on the fifth season, during which Vince was pursuing a role in Van Sant's new film. Despite Ari's protests, Eric tracks down the director to try to talk him into meeting with Vince. Van Sant finally agrees to watch footage of Vince's current project, Smoke Jumpers, and calls Eric to tell him he loves the footage and would love to work with Vince — just not on his own current film. Vince, upset at hearing the news, fires Eric, claiming he had made the actor look desperate.</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Sasha Grey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SashaGrey_a_l.jpg><p>The porn star, playing herself, strikes up a relationship with Vince in the seventh season, during which the actor begins his struggle with drugs. After hearing Sasha is considering taking a role in an upcoming porn film, he becomes jealous and tries to land her a part in his own upcoming movie, but she interprets the move as an attempt to control her life and ends their relationship.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Jeffrey Tambor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JeffreyTambor_a_l.jpg><p>Tambor has played a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes. In the show, the actor is portrayed as a client of Ari's, whom he regularly annoys by popping up unannounced since the agent won't return his calls.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Jamie Lynn Sigler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JamieLynnSigler_a_l.jpg><p>Turtle has a chance encounter with the actress, playing herself, on an airplane, where the two have a sexual encounter. When he tells his friends about the incident, she initially gets upset, but she later forgives him and they end up dating for several episodes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>James Cameron</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/entouragejamescameron4464878hgbmd_a_l.jpg><p>The second season of Entourage focused on Vince's role in the big-budget adaptation of Aquaman, directed by <strong>James Cameron</strong>, who played himself. When Vince's agent, Ari, is unable to close his contract, Vince himself convinces Cameron to give him the part.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Bobby Flay</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bobbyflayentourage_a_l.jpg><p>Reality chef <strong>Bobby Flay</strong> joined the family during Entourage's final season, dating Ari’s estranged wife during their separation. In a surprising confrontation, Ari finds Bobby in his own house cooking dinner and opts not to engage in physical combat, but instead leaves the scene. The future of Mrs. Ari's relationship with either man remains uncertain heading into the series finale.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Anna Faris</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AnnaFaris_a_l.jpg><p>In the fourth season, Eric decides to expand his fledging management business beyond Vince, his only client.
