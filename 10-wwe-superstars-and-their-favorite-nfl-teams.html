<time>02 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>With the big game slated to go down this weekend, fans around the world may tune in for the action while others might simply tune in for the commercials.</p><p>While many fans around the world tune in to the game, they'll likely be joined by the WWE Universe as well as many WWE superstars to watch the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Rams</a> take on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New England Patriots</a> in order to call themselves the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a> Champions.</p><p>A lot of pro wrestlers have had their moments in the sun at big sports games, like when Seth Rollins was interviewed while attending a Bears' game and when he threw out the first pitch at a Baltimore Orioles game.</p><p>Wrestlers like the Miz, Dolph Ziggler and CM Punk have thrown out their first pitches at MLB games while Daniel Bryan had the honor of raising the '12th Man' flag at a Seattle Seahawks game.</p><p>Daniel Bryan also wrestled in the Seahawks' colors for much of the Fall of 2018 while Seth Rollins triumphed in the Royal Rumble while sporting the time-honoured navy and orange of the Chicago Bears.</p><p>Which superstars are fans of NFL teams? Here are some WWE superstars who are avid fans of particular NFL teams.</p><h2>#10. Bayley - San Francisco 49ers</h2><figure class=image>Bayley attended an Indianapolis Colts' game to cheer on the 49ers.</figure><p>The Hugger is a big fan of the San Francisco 49ers. She is from the city of Newark, California, which sits on the southern tip of San Francisco Bay. Since she grew up in such close proximity to San Francisco, it's not a huge surprise that she is a 49ers fan.</p><p>Being 29 years old, she missed the heyday of the 49ers in the 1980s when Joe Montana led the team to four Super Bowl titles.</p><p>She did probably get to revel in the 1994 title after the 49ers and Steve Young downed the San Diego Chargers, but she would have only been four or five years old.</p><p>Bayley and former boyfriend, Aaron Solow, attended a 49ers game with fellow WWE superstar and Titus O'Neil in the photo above. I guess she's lucky that the 49ers weren't one of the teams that recently moved to Los Angeles like the Rams and Chargers.</p><h2>#9. Luke Harper - Washington Redskins</h2><figure class=image>Luke Harper decked out in Redskins' gear.</figure><p>Former WWE superstar Brodie Lee, also known as 'Luke Harper', recently succumbed to a lung disease in 2020. The former Wyatt Family member and Bludgeon Brother is a tried and true fan of the Washington Redskins.</p><p>He's been a big fan of the team and has even gone on local radio shows in order to talk about the team and preview seasons for the team. He also dressed his son in full Redskins' regalia in the above photo.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper</a>'s love of the team goes back to the times when Deion Sanders and Bruce Smith were actually members of the team briefly.</p><p>Haper was a mainstay in WWE's midcard and tag team division during the 2010's partnering with fellow Wyatt family member Luke Harper.</p><p>He then moved to rival brand AEW like scores of other WWE superstars before losing a battle to a lung-related complication.</p><p>Harper is a one-time WWE interncontinental champion and two-time Smackdown tag team champion. He also won the tag titles during his limited stay with AEW.</p><h2>#8. Baron Corbin - Kansas City Chiefs</h2><figure class=image>The former interim-GM was on the edge of his seat during the AFC Championship Game.</figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baron Corbin</a> is from Kansas and has had stints on the practice squads of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arizona Cardinals</a> and Indianapolis Colts of the NFL. Since his NFL career didn't pan out the way he had hoped, Corbin entered the world of professional wrestling.</p><p>The Kansas City Chiefs are from a city that sits on the border of Kansas and Missouri. A lot of people who were fans of the St. Louis Rams might not be any more since the team moved to Los Angeles recently.</p><p>But Corbin has always been a Chiefs fan and even sweated out the back-and-forth nature of this season's AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and the New England Patriots.</p><p>He sent out numerous tweets as the Patriots and the Chiefs traded the lead throughout the second half:</p><p>The Chiefs ended up losing to the Patriots, and fellow WWE superstar and Pats' fan Carmella had some fun with Corbin:</p><p>Corbin has been one of WWE's most impressive heels over the last few years and boasts of an Andre The Giant memorial battle royal win at Wrestlemania 32.</p><h2>#7. Charlotte Flair - Carolina Panthers</h2><figure class=image>The Queen has stayed loyal to her home state football team.</figure><p>As most wrestling fans know, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ric Flair</a> is from North Carolina. Sure, he moved around a lot as a kid but he settled down in North Carolina. Until the mid-1990s, North and South Carolina didn't have an NFL team. But in 1995, the league added both the Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>In just the team's second year, the Panthers made it to the NFC Championship game where they ultimately fell to the Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers. Since she was raised in North Carolina and her WWE namesake is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte</a>, aka the Queen City, it's no surprise that Flair is a Panthers' fan.</p><p>She showed her love for the team when Carolina met the Peyton Manning-led Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 in 2016. The Panthers would go on to lose 24-10 to the Broncos. Too bad the Panthers haven't won as many Super Bowls as Flair has WWE Championships.</p><p>Charlotte has been one of the mainstays of WWE's "Divas Revolution." She has won the Raw and Smackdown Women's championship titles a combined record of nine times.</p><h2>#6. Rey Mysterio - San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers</h2><figure class=image>If you didn't know, Rey Mysterio hails from the 619, better known as San Diego, California.</figure><p>It's been in his theme song throughout his WWE run, noting that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rey Mysterio</a> is from the 619. His home town is a big deal to Mysterio and he grew to love the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Chargers</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for Mysterio and the rest of San Diego, the team recently moved to Los Angeles, giving the city two teams along with the similarly relocated Rams. Even though the team moved, Mysterio is always showing his love, whether it's with a mask showing the team's colors (powder blue, yellow and white) or even like the photo above.</p><p>And Mysterio's love of the city also extends to the Padres. He's had masks made to commemorate the team. It's probably the love for the Chargers that got his son, Dominic, into playing football in the first place.</p><p>If there is one WWE superstar who is synonymous with the city where he is from, it has to be Rey Mysterio.</p><h2>#5. & #4. The Miz, Dolph Ziggler - Cleveland Browns</h2><figure class=image>Things are looking up for the Browns and Miz after 2018.</figure><p>If you've followed the WWE for the last 10 years, then you know that both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolph Ziggler</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Miz</a> hail from Ohio. Both guys are also huge fans of a lot of Cleveland sports' teams from the Browns to the Cavaliers.</p><p>It takes a die-hard fan to stick with a team like the Browns. They've had horrible saves for one season since rejoining the league in 1999. That was until a guy named Baker Mayfield got drafted first overall last year and proceeded to lead the team to a near .500 record.</p><p>While that type of record might not be all that impressive, keep in mind that the Browns went 0-16 in 2018 and have one of the worst cumulative records of the last decade.</p><p>It appears things are heading in the right direction for the Miz and Ziggler's NFL team. Will the two superstars share the upward trajectory the Browns started at the beginning of the 2018 season?</p><p>Both Miz and Ziggler joined WWE as rookies and have honed their skills to establish themselves as lethal competition in the locker room.</p><h2>#3. Seth Rollins - The Chicago Bears</h2><figure class=image>The former IC Champion is a huge fan of the Bears.</figure><p>Being from Davenport, Iowa, there aren't a lot of professional sports teams to root for. So what do you do if you live in a state that doesn't have any? You find the closest team to you and become a fan of that team.</p><p>That's what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rollins</a> did with the Bears. He's attended numerous games and was even interviewed at a Bears' game when he was the WWE Champion. He even managed to stay a football fan after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Bears</a> lost a heartbreaking Wildcard Round 16-15 game to the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>And did you catch his ring gear from the Royal Rumble? He was draped in the signature colors of the Chicago Bears.</p><figure class=image>Rollins won the 2019 Royal Rumble match sporting the navy blue and orange of his beloved Bears.</figure><p>The Monday Night Messiah is certainly a passionate individual, whether it concerns his love for the Chicago Bears or for the professional wrestling business. His impressive stint as a member of the decorated Shield faction earned him a spot as the face of the company under the watchful eyes of the Authority.</p><p>Rollins has since gone from strength to strength to cement his position as one of WWE's top superstars.</p><h2>#2. Daniel Bryan - the Seattle Seahawks</h2><figure class=image>The Planet's Champion is a fan of the Seattle Seahawks.</figure><p>Former WWE Champion or 'The Planet's Champion' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Bryan</a> if we want to get technical, is a huge fan of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Seahawks</a>. He hails from Aberdeen, Washington and has been a frequent celebrity fan throughout the team's recent tenure.</p><p>Bryan has raised the '12th Man Flag' before games and has even led the crowd in 'Yes' chants back when he still approved of those. It must have been tough to coax his wife, Brie Bella, into being a Seahawks fan instead of an Eagles fan.</p><p>Both teams have won Super Bowls within the last five years, so I guess they are both happy with their team's success. Apparently, Daniel Bryan is also raising daughter Birdie Joe to be a Seahawks fan, rather than a Cardinals' fan, since the Bellas are from Arizona, or an Eagles fan.</p><p>Daniel Bryan is one of WWE's most technically gifted wrestlers and is a four-time WWE champion in his own right.</p><h2>#1. Triple H/Stephanie McMahon, Kofi Kingston, Carmella, Sasha Banks - New England Patriots</h2><figure class=image>A lot of WWE superstars are fans of the AFC Champion New England Patriots.</figure><p>Before you even say 'of course the power couple of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple H</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephanie McMahon</a> are bandwagon fans of the Patriots', examine their pasts first.</p><p>Triple H is originally from Nashua, New Hampshire and McMahon is from Connecticut. Since neither state has its own NFL team, they followed the New England Patriots or a team that represents several states in the US.</p><p>Not only are they big fans of the Pats, but they are big fans of the NFL and other pro sports. Triple H often sends WWE Championships to the respective champions of American sports leagues like the NFL, MLB, NBA or NHL.</p><p>So yes, the McMahons and Triple H are legitimate fans of the New England Patriots and not just because they have won so much over the last 20 years.</p><p>Other fans of the current AFC champs include Sasha Banks and Kofi Kingston, who both hail from the Boston, Massachusetts area, and former SmackDown Women's Champion Carmella.</p><p>Carmella was once a cheerleader for both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Patriots. She even got into it on Twitter this year with Baron Corbin during the AFC Championship Game.</p><p class=article-p>Quick Links</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/article/article-scroll-left.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/article/article-scroll-right.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>More from Sportskeeda</p>" modalPopup.closeOnEsc = false;
