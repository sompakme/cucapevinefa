To increase the challenge, the Night Wolves incorporated devious obstacles and traps throughout the race.

The leader abruptly took off his helmet as he raced to catch up with him, shocking him since it was Joon, Jay’s elder brother, who had vanished five years earlier.</p><p>Joon needed Min for his plot to take over the city, and he revealed he was now the leader of the Night Wolves. He refused to let her leave. Jay was taken aback and puzzled by this information, wondering why Joon had joined the Night Wolves and what his strategy was. Joon promised to give him an explanation as soon as Jay defeated him in a race.</p><p>Joon would take Jay’s bike if he lost, while Min would be freed if Jay prevailed. More than anything, he was trying to figure out who was a better brother and who was a better rider. Jay agreed to go despite being startled and perplexed in the hopes of saving Min and getting Joon back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Raw_Scan_Release_Date></span><strong>Raw Scan Release Date </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The raw scan for Wind Breaker chapter 473 is expected to be released on <strong>November 30, 2023</strong>, at 12:00 PM KST (Korean Standard Time).
