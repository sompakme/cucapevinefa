Mau plays Teri, a confident trans woman and therapist whose life is thrown into chaos when her boyfriend, Donny Dunn (played by series creator Richard Gadd), becomes targeted by a stalker named Martha (Jessica Gunning). Teri and Donny have a sweet connection, but their romance is doomed from the start, as Donny tries to keep Teri a secret out of his internalized transphobia and shame. Their ill-fated relationship may not last the show, but it's an important, complex depiction of queer dating that often goes unseen on mainstream television.</p><p>Mau shines as Teri, embodying the character's unapologetic self-assurance and empathy towards Martha, as well as her strength in standing up for herself when the stalker eventually crosses a line towards the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/baby-reindeer-ending-explained/>end of the series</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In real life, the Mexico-born actress, filmmaker, and producer is just as fearless and a passionate advocate for the trans community. Read on to meet the actress who brought Baby Reindeer's Teri to life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N5EHTg2vhtaYJjP9yyEvsk-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=she-apos-s-a-trans-latina-filmmaker-and-cultural-worker-3>She's a trans Latina filmmaker and cultural worker.</h2><p>Mau, a Mexico City native, made her debut as a filmmaker by writing, directing, and starring in the 2019 short film <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://vimeo.com/336288086 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100577549-14424604?sid=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https://vimeo.com/336288086" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=vimeo.com data-merchant-id=5177 data-merchant-url=vimeo.com data-merchant-network=CJ>Waking Hour</a>. Since then, she has appeared as an actor in the short films Femenina, Sam's Town, and Work. The latter two, in addition to the short Lovebites, the rising star helped to producer, as well. She also notably served as a Production Fellow on the Netflix documentary Disclosure about LGBTQ+ representation in Hollywood.</p><p>According to her official <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.navamau.com/culture-change referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>website</a>, Mau has also worked in the fields of anti-violence, healing justice, and political education for over eight years as a public speaker, advocate, and workshop facilitator. She previously worked with survivors of violence as both a legal assistant and a peer counselor.

"Thus, I think that, for projects where I am leading, it is really important to me to continue to bring in the frameworks that I believe in from my cultural work. I also believe that culture change is desperately needed in the film industry, so I hope to never let go of that. That is my mission."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

On the coming of age series about a group of teens discovering their sexuality, Mau played Ana, the beloved aunt of one of the show's main characters, Greta (Haley Sanchez). Ana and Mau's performance became a fan-favorite, as she takes in her niece after her mother is deported and becomes a source of support while she's coming to terms with her sexuality.</p><p>"It was palpable even in the pilot script that the relationship between Ana and Greta is special," Mau said of the characters' bond, in an interview with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.flaunt.com/blog/nava-mau referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Flaunt</a>. "They really need each other, and I don’t think either of them quite knew that before they were thrown into this new dynamic."</p><p>She also shared what spoke to her about the character, saying, "Ana learns about the power of responsibility. She does her best, and I would say it turns out her best is pretty good for these kids. What I didn’t know was that I really needed Ana. She shows me what it means to be abundantly giving and unafraid, even in the face of a judgmental world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j38v2tHesNBZqKnPMz5pgk-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=she-felt-a-quot-great-sense-of-responsibility-quot-while-playing-teri-in-apos-baby-reindeer-apos-3>She felt a "great sense of responsibility" while playing Teri in 'Baby Reindeer.'</h2><p>Mau has opened up about how she felt a special connection to her Baby Reindeer role.&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a60521500/baby-reindeer-nava-mau-real/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Digital Spy</a>, she shared in a U.K. press screening, "When I read [the script], I could tell that [creator] Richard [Gadd] really loved her, whoever inspired this character.
