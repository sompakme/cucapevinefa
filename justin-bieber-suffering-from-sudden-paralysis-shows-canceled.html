In a short video posted to his verified Instagram account, Bieber addressed his fans and said that he was experiencing facial paralysis due to the syndrome. During the course of the video, it appeared one of his eyes was unable to blink and he described himself as “physically, obviously, not capable” of performing in his condition. Here is Justin Bieber’s Instagram video:</p><p>During the nearly three-minute video, Justin Bieber briefly describes Ramsay Hunt syndrome as deriving from a virus and that the symptoms of the paralysis would be temporary, though he stated that his doctors did not know how long they would affect him. He also apologized to his fans for being unable to perform (stating it was what he was “born to do”) and affirmed his belief in his Christian faith and that God would assist him in his medical issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The paralysis affecting Justin Bieber is a symptom of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. As described by the <a href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>, Ramsay Hunter syndrome (also known as herpes zoster oticus) is an effect of a shingles outbreak near the ears, which can cause a facial nerve to be attacked. While it can also cause temporary deafness, it is not known if Justin Bieber is currently experiencing that effect. Herpes zoster is the strain of virus known as shingles; it occurs when the strain of herpes referred to as chickenpox lies dormant and then reactivates, commonly in adulthood. Both Ramsay Hunt syndrome and shingles most often occur in adults above the age of 60, though it is not unknown for it to be activated by stress in younger people (which the 28-year-old Justin Bieber probably experiences as one of the most famous pop stars in the world).&nbsp;</p><p>Justin Bieber took care to stress that the effects of Ramsay Hunt syndrome were temporary, there can be long-term effects. They most commonly occur in untreated bouts of the virus, so hopefully, Justin Bieber and his medical team identified the issue as quickly as possible. The singer also referred to rest and treatment several times in the video; while it is likely that he is trying to get back on tour to support his Changes, Justice, and Freedom album as quickly as possible, it is sensible that he treats his paralysis with the care it deserves.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not the only time recently that Justin Bieber has had to cancel tour dates due to physical illness. In February of this year, the singer had to <a href=#>cancel</a> several performances in Las Vegas due to what was described as a “mild” case of Covid-19. While many fans were vocally upset and disappointed in his cancelations, hopefully, audiences understand the potential severity of both of these conditions. In addition, his wife&nbsp; Hailey Bieber experienced a “mini-stroke” in March due to a blood clot that required surgery. We wish Justin and Hailey Bieber both a speedy recovery for their health.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnmqrAtbXNZpminZKav268wKuYpbGjnsBuv8eorqxlk5a7pLHLpZydZpipuq0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjustin-bieber-suffering-from-sudden-paralysis-shows-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjustin-bieber-suffering-from-sudden-paralysis-shows-canceled.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjustin-bieber-suffering-from-sudden-paralysis-shows-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjustin-bieber-suffering-from-sudden-paralysis-shows-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjustin-bieber-suffering-from-sudden-paralysis-shows-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjustin-bieber-suffering-from-sudden-paralysis-shows-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./photos-of-mana-nakatomi-on-mycast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./photos-of-mana-nakatomi-on-mycast.html>Photos of Mana Nakatomi on myCast</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./june-squibb-sundance-comedy-thelma-lands-at-magnolia.html>June Squibb Sundance Comedy Thelma Lands at Magnolia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./june-squibb-sundance-comedy-thelma-lands-at-magnolia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
