The young star's early life saw her star in several TV commercial campaigns, plus in the soap opera , before she landed her breakout film role in Disney's absolutely beloved<strong>&nbsp;</strong>remake of directed by rom-com queen Nancy Meyers, in 1998.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Lindsay Lohan's baby will have alternate living situation far different from famous mom's upbringing" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ad6503d09258-gettyimages-542344428.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Lindsay Lohan's baby will have alternate living situation far different from famous mom's upbringing" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Lindsay Lohan's baby will have alternate living situation far different from famous mom's upbringing</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/43680953ad45-lindsay-lohan-story-2.jpg><p id=enRWkL0RqNPh data-wc=91>Immediately loved for her naturalistic acting talent and charismatic onscreen personality — not to mention that trademark red hair and freckles — the then 12-year-old was later cast <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>alongside Jamie Lee Curtis</a></strong> in another hugely successful remake, the mother-daughter body switch film<strong>&nbsp;</strong> at the age of 16.

However, with this fame came what is now widely recognized as more pressure and scrutiny than any regular 17-year-old should have to manage.</p><h2><strong>Troubled years</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b3b138b1a07f-lindsay-lohan-story-3.jpg><p id=eg4MG4fsucdq data-wc=87>While professionally Lindsay Lohan continued to take lead roles and was branching out to explore other careers like music (she released two LPs in the aughts), the 18-year-old was also beginning to build up a reputation for being a troubled young star. Several reports were published about her being lost in an excessive party lifestyle, and individuals who worked with the young star at the time such as studio executive James G. Robinson began to comment to the press about problems working with the actress on set.</p><p id=eVlDaBI_bM6j data-wc=12><strong>SEE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lindsay Lohan transforms into a glamorous mom-to-be in stunning new photos</a></p><p id=eyzb6BPvGlHp data-wc=62>It became public knowledge that, by the time she was 20, Lindsay was struggling with addiction, leading to stressful film sets, canceled projects, and rehab stays. At the same time, the previous box office hit winner's films began to fail at the box office and win her less than rave reviews, all of which didn't appear to help her already troubled state.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c3242004a6ac-lindsay-lohan-story-4.jpg><p id=e85Qs1RfHbsp data-wc=63>From 2007 onwards, Lindsay began to gain a reputation for the many occasions in which she was arrested for offenses including suspicion of driving under the influence and the possession of drugs. But in 2012, despite the fact that most of the public and press' narrative had turned against Lindsay, she showed strength as she began to emerge out of her low period.</p><h2><strong>Beating the bad habits</strong></h2><p id=eTj7OL0hITt1 data-wc=85>In 2013 and 2014, Lindsay Lohan took on many projects in both film and television as well as her first ever West End role in as she tried to reconstruct her image on the worldwide stage as a serious actress. Her performances received mixed reviews, as did her brief stint as the focus of the reality TV show on <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Opera Winfrey</a></strong>'s OWN network, however the former child star was still successfully beginning to take back control of her image and career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e17d14283214-lindsay-lohan-story-5.jpg><p id=eR985bVWPuOo data-wc=55>In 2018, Lindsay's recurring role in the Sky One series gained her increasingly positive attention for her work, and this was followed by some more reality TV roles. This included her stint on MTV's which revealed more about her involvement as the founder of an Athens based beach club.</p><p id=eCO5EFX72SE data-wc=13><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Lindsay Lohan shares heartfelt message as she rests at home during pregnancy</a></strong></p><p id=ea1oPtREMrr data-wc=98>As well as diversifying her projects, Lindsay life also improved when she made the decision to move from her home in Hollywood to the United Arab Emirates in 2014. Speaking with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Vogue</a> in 2022, the actress revealed that the move to Dubai had allowed her to make a fresh start, and that the location was very helpful for her journey. "I got there, and I felt a certain sense of calm," she said. "I think it's because paparazzi is illegal there. I really found that I had a private life, and I could just take time for myself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/90a2d2e7a1e6-lindsay-lohan-story-6.jpg><p id=eD8LhWrQlU3 data-wc=82>While Covid got in the way of her returning to her role as a well-liked judge on The Masked Singer, Lindsay's professional career and reputation had by now been effectively restored, and public sympathy had returned in her favor. In 2021, her image was strengthened yet again by her successfully signing on as <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>the lead in Netflix's Christmas romcom</a></strong> Falling for Christmas, and the later news that she would be starring in two more romcoms for the platform in the not-too-distant future.</p><h2><strong>Happy family life</strong></h2><p id=ej0tYSlEI0 data-wc=50>On April 3, 2022, Lindsay Lohan <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>married her boyfriend</a></strong> of three years Bader Shammas during a private ceremony.
