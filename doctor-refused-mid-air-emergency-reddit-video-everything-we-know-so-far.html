The 30-year-old internal medicine hospitalist took to social media and shared the experience, which occurred under unique conditions. His decision, possibly affected by drinking prior to and during flight time, raised ethical and professional considerations when such situations arise.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What Led to the Doctor’s Decision?</h3><p>The doctor’s decision was heavily impacted by his level of intoxication during the flight, as evidenced by his social media post describing this experience. As per his account on social media, he consumed alcohol before and during his long-haul flight – often during normal waking hours – enjoying inflight entertainment and the complimentary beverages onboard.</p><p>Alcohol impairs judgment and cognitive functions, and the doctor acknowledged he was too intoxicated to think clearly or act responsibly during flight. This self-awareness played an instrumental role in his decision not to respond to an emergency call for a doctor on board the flight.</p><p>Situations such as those faced by the doctor raise vital issues regarding how best to balance personal time with professional obligations in an environment where their actions could have significant repercussions. His decision not to offer medical assistance due to his impaired state indicates a delicate balance of ethical considerations and personal judgment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did the Doctor Justify His Inaction?</h2><p>The doctor defended his inaction based on the potential risk of doing more harm than good. Given his intoxicated state, he recognized that intervening could potentially prove counter-productive and this decision – although contentious – adheres to medical ethics’ core principle of “do no harm.”</p><p>In his post, the doctor mentioned how, under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t hesitate to offer assistance; however, due to alcohol consumption on his part and other circumstances influencing this case, his intervention might actually be counterproductive and should be avoided. This point highlights medical professionals’ responsibility in not only acting when needed but also recognising when their interventions might prove harmful.</p><p>The doctor’s decision also shows an understanding of his professional limits at that moment. By opting not to intervene, he was hoping that another passenger with medical expertise might be available and in a better condition to assist, or that cabin crew could manage the situation under guidance from medical professionals on the ground.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What Was the Reaction of Fellow Passengers?</h3><p>Reaction of fellow passenger, particularly the woman sitting next to the doctor, adds another layer to this incident. According to him, her reaction was one of disbelief and condemnation – she accused him of irresponsibility and suggested any negative outcome would be his responsibility.</p><p>This response highlights societal expectations regarding medical professionals. There can be an assumption that doctors will always be there when needed, regardless of circumstances; her response could be seen as reflecting these assumptions, with an apparent misunderstanding about his state and potential risks involved with him being involved.</p><p>This incident highlights the complex dynamics of public perception and responsibility often shouldering by medical professionals outside their formal work environments. A woman accusing her doctor of inaction that could have lead to death for their patient underlines the high stakes involved in emergency situations and moral and ethical dilemmas professionals often have to navigate in their everyday lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH51gZRqZp2nk6m8s3nRnp2uq5WZeq61w2aYoqpdmrqmvsaepZyxXZm8rq3Ip5ZqaF2rtqWxzmacr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMrKZmnpGnfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoctor-refused-mid-air-emergency-reddit-video-everything-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoctor-refused-mid-air-emergency-reddit-video-everything-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoctor-refused-mid-air-emergency-reddit-video-everything-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoctor-refused-mid-air-emergency-reddit-video-everything-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoctor-refused-mid-air-emergency-reddit-video-everything-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoctor-refused-mid-air-emergency-reddit-video-everything-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elena-brower-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elena-brower-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Elena Brower Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./billy-mitchell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Billy Mitchell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./billy-mitchell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
