There was a time when Sting made some personal choices that went on to hurt people who were very close to him, and that included his ex-wife.</p><p>Sting is celebrated for his accomplishments in the world of professional wrestling, and he has left an unquestionable mark on the business. The Icon’s career saw him rise to prominence in WCW before embarking on a successful run in TNA. After a short stint in WWE, he “retired” and then was picked up by AEW a little bit later.</p><p>Sting once opened up on his personal life during his appearance on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chasing Glory with Lilian Garcia</a>.&nbsp;The Icon recollected the challenging period when he courageously confessed to his wife about his transgressions, and how this process led him to a spiritual awakening.</p><p>“I confessed everything to my ex-wife. I was honest and truthful. It was horrendous, it was one of the worst moments of my life watching her life blood just come out of her almost, it was just horrendous. God at that point, I said, “Okay, I have given God lip service,” I literally said this prayer. And I had, nothing was real to me. Finally, August of 1998, when I realized there’s no amount of money, no amount of power, no drug, no woman, no man, no doctor, nothing, nothing is going to fix this horrendous deep dark despair and I have messed lives up everywhere.”</p><p>Sting certainly learned a lot, and he doesn’t live that life now. He went on to talk about how his personal spiritual journey helped him surrender everything over to a higher power.</p><p>“I cannot fix this on my own. I need some supernatural and I said, ‘God, I surrender my life to you.’ So that’s what happened to me in August of 1998, when I was at the very peak of my career. Muscle relaxers, pain relievers, alcohol, women, a lifestyle, even language that comes out of my mouth, everything changed radically overnight, and I was watching friends die from this kind of lifestyle over the years.”&nbsp;</p><p>We’ll have to see when Sting decides to retire. At this point, <a href=#>he will end his career on his terms, </a>and Tony Khan <a href=#>isn’t about to suggest that he wrap things up</a>. Sting will wrestle once again with Darby Allin in a tag team match at All In London at Wembley Stadium on August 27th.</p><p>Sting has certainly grown a lot since starting his pro wrestling career. He is also able to speak very candidly about it as well, and now he might be able to help others who are dealing with the same crossroads and road bumps in life.</p><p>What’s your take on what Sting said?
