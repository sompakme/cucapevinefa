If the carburetor has been thoroughly cleaned, there is no need for any type of gasket sealer in ANY location. Check for small bits of old gaskets (especially if a gasket sealer has been used in the past), small bits of rust, dirt, and other such things if the surfaces are not perfectly flat.
Do carburetor gaskets, on the other hand, require sealant? Because of the studs on the manifold, it may not be necessary to replace the carburetor gasket, but it can’t hurt.</description></item><item><title>Gal Gadot reveals why rarely-seen daughter Maya was 'disappointed' over her upcoming role</title><link>/gal-gadot-reveals-why-rarely-seen-daughter-maya-was-disappointed-over-her-upcoming-role.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gal-gadot-reveals-why-rarely-seen-daughter-maya-was-disappointed-over-her-upcoming-role.html</guid><description>The&amp;nbsp;Wonder Woman actress will star as the Evil Queen opposite Rachel Zegler in the 2024 movie Gal Gadot has an army of loyal supporters in her fans, plus surely, in her three daughters, but that doesn't mean her girls always understand her movie roles.

Hopefully,&amp;nbsp;guys don't judge a woman by her hair color, but they do have perceptions based on culture, media, and personal taste, similar to unconscious interpretation of inkblots.
What's my "inkblot-style" reaction to brunettes?

風邪をあまり悲惨な状態にしないためには亜鉛の力を信じ、すぐに摂れば具合が悪くならないと言う人がいる。亜鉛はミネラル界の"宝石"なのか、それとも単なる思い込みなのか？専門家に話を聞いてみた。
亜鉛は風邪の症状に効果的？何をもって"効果的"とするかによる。亜鉛には風邪を防いだり治すと言えるほど十分なデータはないが、回復を早めることはできるかもしれない。2013年に行われた、ある系統的レビューで、風邪の症状が現れてから24時間以内に亜鉛を摂取すれば、風邪の期間を12〜24時間短くするのに役立つかもしれないことがわかっている。
つまり、息苦しい感じがし始めたらすぐに亜鉛を摂取すれば、平均7日間と言われる風邪の期間が、もしかすると6日間になるかもしれないということだ。それに価値があるかどうかは、あなたの見方次第だ。
研究者の中には、亜鉛が役に立つかどうかは、通常、風邪の原因になる迷惑な病原体ライノウイルスにどう作用するかによると、内科医で『MCG Health』の医師編集者のクリスティーナ・ランドバーグは言う。
ライノウイルスは鼻腔や喉（上気道系）で増殖する傾向にあるが、「亜鉛が人間のライノウイルスが鼻腔の粘膜につくのを防ぐ役に立つというエビデンスがあり、それによってウイルスの複製を遅らせ、風邪の症状緩和につながることが期待できるのです。とはいえ、亜鉛がウイルス性の病気に役立つメガニズムはあまりよく理解されていませんけどね」とランドバーグ。
亜鉛を摂取するベストな方法は？亜鉛を摂取する方法はいろいろある。まず、シロップやドロップ（トローチ）で摂ることができ、免疫力を高める成分（抗酸化物質が豊富なエルダーベリーなど）や、苦味のある成分を飲みやすくするための香料などがミックスされていることが多い。
また、亜鉛をそのまま錠剤やカプセルで摂るという方法もある。
どちらがより効果的なのだろう？ランドバーグ医師によると、亜鉛のサプリかドロップか、あるいは他の形かを比較する研究はなされていないので判定はできない。
だが、ドロップが「現在出ている中ではベストな処方。ドロップやシロップは鼻腔や咽頭に留まり、体内に吸収されていくのでベストではないかと考える人がいます」とランドバーグ。
亜鉛を摂取するタイミングについては、風邪かな？と思ったら、すぐに摂ること。「風邪の症状に何らかのメリットを得るには、風邪の症状が出たら24時間以内に取り始めましょう」とランドバーグ。
「風邪にかかったら、毎日、10日間ほど摂ります。処方によって異なるので、パッケージで推奨されている説明に従いましょう」
風邪のときに亜鉛を摂ってもリスクはないの？メイヨー・クリニックによると、亜鉛を経口摂取するのは一般的には安全だが、ドロップは後味の悪さが残るという人や、吐き気を催すという人もいるという。だが、専門家のほとんどは、スプレーで鼻から亜鉛を摂ることには反対している。人によっては、永久に嗅覚を失う原因になるからだ。
また、亜鉛は特定の薬剤を妨げることも知られている。例えば、抗生物質を服用している場合、亜鉛は体が適切にそれを吸収するのを妨げるため、細菌と戦う力を弱めてしまう可能性がある。
あるいは、関節リウマチの治療でぺニシラミンを服用している場合、亜鉛は関節の痛みを和らげる薬の力を低減してしまうかもしれない。
そのため、薬を服用している場合は、亜鉛サプリを摂る前に医師に相談するのがベストだ。
結論：亜鉛で風邪を治すことはできないが、回復を早める助けになる可能性はある総合的に見て、クリーブランド・クリニックの専門家は、風邪から早く回復するベストで最も安全な方法は、たっぷり休養をとることだと言う。
水分をたっぷりと摂って鼻や喉の潤いを保ちながら、乾燥させるアルコールやカフェインを避けると、消化を助け炎症を鎮める役に立つ一方、鼻や喉の粘膜からできるだけ早くウイルスを除去することができる。
だから、できれば仕事を休み、ハーブティーで温まり、よく眠ること。1週間程度で元気になるはずだ。だが、症状が10日経っても治まらない場合は、病院で特別な治療が必要な病気（気管支炎や肺炎、副鼻腔感染症など）にかかっていないかどうか診察してもらおう。
