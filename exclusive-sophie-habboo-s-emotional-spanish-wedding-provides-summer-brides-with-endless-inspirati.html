The podcasters tied the knot in a spectacular al fresco ceremony following their legal wedding at Chelsea Old Town Hall in London just weeks prior. The bride and groom were surrounded by their nearest and dearest dressed in their finery as they pledged to spend the rest of their lives together in a truly picturesque setting that had fairytale written all over it.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Exclusive: Sophie Habboo stuns in gorgeous fitted activewear as she looks ahead to a 'year of love'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4e5c990af9da-231124usaproxsophiehabbooshot180191.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Exclusive: Sophie Habboo stuns in gorgeous fitted activewear as she looks ahead to a 'year of love'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Exclusive: Sophie Habboo stuns in gorgeous fitted activewear as she looks ahead to a 'year of love'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Beauty Receipts: What Made In Chelsea star Sophie Habboo’s monthly beauty routine looks like" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/62d3011ce774-beauty-recipts-sophie-habboo-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Beauty Receipts: What Made In Chelsea star Sophie Habboo’s monthly beauty routine looks like" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Beauty Receipts: What Made In Chelsea star Sophie Habboo’s monthly beauty routine looks like</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e3i-k7kn100 data-wc=67>The setting radiated natural beauty, much like the blushing bride who stunned in an ethereal lace gown made bespoke by Emma Beaumont. A far cry from the stylish Vivienne Westwood mini dress that wore as she and Jamie were covered in confetti at their London do, the floor-length figure-hugging gown with intricately detailed sleeves and an elegant train was about as classic and timeless as it gets.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e890e0bed03-sophie-habboo-wedding.jpg><p id=et8cC5428dA data-wc=71>"They were very different," Sophie says, recalling the contrasting dresses. "I've always wanted lace and I knew I wanted lace sleeves. I had a vision for the Spanish wedding, I didn't have a vision for the English wedding. It really just came together very sporadically, it wasn't that planned. I like the look of it but I always knew what I wanted for my Spanish wedding. I wanted kind of traditional."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=ejSjzWHRUix data-wc=66>The aesthetic of the English ceremony felt modern, with Sophie sporting a bow in her hair and a pair of stunning diamanté-encrusted Jimmy Choo heels. Jamie grew up around Chelsea and she says that it "felt right" to officially tie the knot there. And yet, Sophie reveals that it was not tightly planned like the Spanish wedding that fans heard about on the wedding-centred podcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d16bbb1652d8-jamie-laing-sophie-habboo.jpg><p id=e17xestEvx7 data-wc=75>"The English wedding just came together, I don't know how it came together!," Sophie says. "The Spanish wedding was a long time that we were getting that dress made and I got it done by a designer called Emma Beaumont and her place is up in Manchester so it was quite a long process. I would go and visit her in Manchester, she would come down to London and it was a really exciting time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f0134d57524-sophie-habboo-mum.jpg><p id=eunokax208L data-wc=101>A special moment for Sophie was her mother, Sarah Wigley, seeing her in the bespoke dress for the first time. Sophie remembers: "It was really emotional. I cried! I had my bridesmaids. My mum was in Portugal because she lives in Portugal so that was sad but she came to all my other fittings. But it was actually quite special because she saw me for the first time on the day which was a big moment when I showed myself on the day before I walked down the aisle as she got ready with me so it was all really special."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/046ae6e0f589-sophie-jamie-bridesmaids.jpg><p id=eibqCw1rO-B data-wc=72>The co-host of the podcast also reveals the highlight of the day in Spain that she had spent so long meticulously planning. "Walking up the aisle with my dad holding my arm and seeing Jamie at the top of the altar was pretty special," she says recalling her day when she was surrounded by family and friends including her former co-stars Sam Thompson, Ruby Adler and Millie Mackintosh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/53a87f71cb86-zara-sam-sophie-jamie-wedding.jpg><p id=e41sUCqSFh3 data-wc=56>Sophie's number one tip for brides who are set to get married this summer is simple. She says: "Don't sweat the small things. I know everyone says it but if you're getting worked up about something or panicking about something, just take 15 minutes to yourself and think 'Why am I really getting worried about this'?'</p><p id=eD-oro7JtNg data-wc=56>"Nothing is worth getting stressed over. I made the mistake of getting a little bit stressed about things and really on the day it's so perfect. It's the most amazing day, everyone there is rooting for you, they're there because they all love you and no one worries if the napkin was rolled the wrong way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/17e9ecf4b88c-sophie-jamied-wedding.jpg><p id=eSTi8e8rSKk data-wc=103>The newlywed also has tips for keeping your hair and makeup in place. Sophie herself wore her hair in loose blow-dried waves for her English do, but for her main event, she went for a slicked bun and wore a timeless makeup look featuring a subtle winged eyeliner and cheek-bone defining contour that had to last in the heat. "Tinted suncream is the best thing ever," Sophie says. "I don't love foundation so I wore this Ultra Violette tinted SPF ['Daydream Screen'] and it's SPF50. Obviously, if you're doing an abroad wedding that is key and now I wear it all the time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a909ed136d29-sophie-habboo-jamie-laing.jpg><p id=e7kCmwCqbeX data-wc=75>She adds that there was also a rather handy trick that she kept up her lace-adorned sleeve for keeping her makeup on all day and all night. &nbsp;"Put your makeup on using a beauty blender," she tells us. "If you spray your beauty blender with setting spray, like I use Charlotte Tilbury ['Airbrush Flawless'] setting spray, your makeup will honestly stay on and it will be flawless and then you put setting spray on afterwards."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/22f47fd3ea47-sophie-jamie-wedding-table.jpg><p id=eHnmIZIpL7z data-wc=103>She also says not skipping your full skincare routine on the morning of your wedding is also key, no matter how excitable things get in your dressing room. Speaking from experience, Sophie tells us that "how your skin is underneath is going to make it ultimately nice and stay on. Keep getting that skincare routine key before you go. Also exfoliating. I know it's hit and miss about how many times you should be exfoliating but I use a daily microexfoliator from Dermalogica so you can use it daily and it gives your skin a really nice surface to put your makeup on."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dc4fb8e8f47d-sophie-habboo-husband.jpg><p id=e0UeGGM-3j data-wc=118>As Sophie enters her first full year of marriage she is looking forward to new adventures with her husband Jamie as they take their podcast on tour, but also solo ventures that pique her interest. The star has launched <a class=hm-link href=#>a new line of gorgeous fitted activewear&nbsp;</a>with USA Pro and she says it is her secret to feeling confident when working out. "This is why the collection has been so amazing because it's really flattering, it's really thick material," she tells us. "It's stretchy, its soft material, the colours are great so that's really why I wanted to design it because I wasn't finding anything I loved working out in, and I love working out in this collection."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4d46b8249970-231124usaproxsophiehabbooshot05portrait-merge-final.jpg><p id=ekUu-lSMzIa data-wc=55>Taking that time for yourself is crucial amongst the joy, and sometimes stress, of wedding planning - a fact Sophie is familiar with. She says that taking time to work out followed by a sauna, a walk in nature or an acai bowl at her favourite post-gym spot is the personal well-being time she cherishes.</p><p id=euZyM3Sbx8r data-wc=37>With two gorgeous ceremonies to take inspiration from, Sophie's wedding is the perfect place to start when creating your bridal mood board or when searching for places you can add that extra sparkle on your special day.</p><p id=efstqtVNSU data-wc=12><strong>DISCOVER:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>9 white hen party dresses for the bride to wow in&nbsp;</a></p><p id=eq5vyIM-LLJ0 data-wc=9><strong></strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>sportsdirect.com/usa-pro/sophie-habboo</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
