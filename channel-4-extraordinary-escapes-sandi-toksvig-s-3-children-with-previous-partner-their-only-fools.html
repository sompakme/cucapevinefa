We had death threats. People actually wanted to kill me!"</p><p>“It’s impossible to understand how much psychological damage has been done over the years, just by people having to keep such an essential part of themselves secret,” she added.</p><p>Sandi spoke about her sexuality in an interview with the Sunday Times, explaining it was having three young children that made her decide to come out.</p><p>After the interview, Save the Children dropped Sandi's services but later were forced to apologise after a protest by the Lesbian Avengers.</p><p>She said to the best of her knowledge there were no "out" lesbians in public life and she didn't want her children to grow up being ashamed of having two mothers.</p><span class=factbox-header><h3>Get the very best of What's On in London straight to your inbox</h3></span><p>London has it all - the best nightlife, food, drink, events, markets, everything!</p><p>But how do you keep on top of this?

Not to me, it doesn’t—I wouldn’t have cared if we’d got them from Tesco.</p><p>“Being a parent is all about the love you give to your child.
