Despite Macy’s typical discounts, there is no apparent change to the marketing of the collection. Representatives for Macy’s declined to comment on <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=4>Seacrest</span> or whether&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=RSD data-scaytid=9>RSD</span> will be impacted by the allegations against him.</p><p>David Katz, <span data-scayt_word=CMO data-scaytid=11>CMO</span> of New York-based&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Randa data-scaytid=12>Randa</span> Accessories, the company that first approached <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=10>Seacrest</span> about creating a fashion brand, responded to the&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter’s request for comment by saying that “ultimately, there is no there, there.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, responses to&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word="Seacrest's" data-scaytid=21>Seacrest’s</span> <span data-scayt_word=RSD data-scaytid=17>RSD</span> Instagram account, <span data-scayt_word=@seacreststyle data-scaytid=19>@seacreststyle</span>, are largely positive. The comment section of the E! host’s Oscars red carpet images are filled with sentiments of support and cries of “Team Ryan.” (The same cannot be said about <span data-scayt_word="Seacrest's" data-scaytid=22>Seacrest’s</span> personal account, which is host to several comment-section debates regarding his reputation.) There’s no way to be sure whether the comments of the <span data-scayt_word=RSD data-scaytid=18>RSD</span>&nbsp;account are being monitored, however, it’s telling that they haven’t been completely disabled.&nbsp;</p><p>In collaboration with skincare expert Dr. Harold Lancer, <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=26>Seacrest</span> <a href=#>launched</a> the Polished by Dr. Lancer and Ryan <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=27>Seacrest</span> collection of men’s products, $10 to $55, in 2017. Regarding his relationship with the host, Lancer tells <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=30>THR</span>, “I have known Ryan for over 15 years and he was absolutely the best partner for Polished. We stand by him and are looking forward to our future brand plans.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Stacy Jones, CEO of marketing and strategy agency <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hollywood Branded</a>, tells&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=32>THR</span> that&nbsp;“Ryan <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=35>Seacrest</span> brands are absolutely in the crossfire at the current moment due to the sexual allegations against him, and customers are looking at [them] in a different light.”&nbsp;</p><p>“At the moment, the focus on sexual misconduct — regardless of its truth — is still too much in the headlines to not have impact on his brand,” adds Jones. “He has <a href=#>taken steps to disprove</a> the allegations, with two featured articles countering the accusations, but in today’s #<span data-scayt_word=MeToo data-scaytid=87>MeToo</span> movement with breaking news, on what feels like a weekly basis, where every male has staunchly denied claims, it’s hard for those readers to know what to believe.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the era of conscious consumerism, where shoppers are not just paying attention to scandals themselves, but also to how brands react to them (take Delta’s public stance on the NRA, for example), a controversy like the one plaguing <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=39>Seacrest</span>&nbsp;can definitely affect a company’s bottom line.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>“When [shoppers] see headline after headline showcasing a scandal or controversy, they may be more likely to shy away from the brand, as what has happened with the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the fallout with Marchesa,” notes Jones, alluding to the backlash against the once-beloved red carpet label, which was founded by Weinstein’s estranged wife Georgina Chapman. Marchesa received no red carpet play this awards season.&nbsp;</span></p><p>On the <a href=#>Oscars red carpet </a>earlier this month, <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=44>Seacrest</span>&nbsp;did take the opportunity to flog his Distinction line, which he does whenever he’s wearing it on TV. But he did not manage to draw much A-list talent to his mic, including any of the best actress nominees, for interviews. (“Flocks of celebrities avoided stopping by and being interviewed by him at the direction of their publicists, who suggested they distance themselves for fear of the unknown of what may come,” says Jones.)</p><p>He did snag interviews with best supporting actress winner Allison <span data-scayt_word=Janney data-scaytid=51>Janney</span> and presenter&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Taraji data-scaytid=52>Taraji</span> P. Henson, however, many interpreted Henson’s interaction as shade. “The universe has a way of taking care of good people,” said Henson, stroking <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=49>Seacrest</span> on the chin. Henson later stated that her comments were misconstrued and she “<a href=# rel=nofollow>absolutely</a>” supports the host.</p><p>Both E! (which ordered a third-party investigation into the stylist’s claims that ultimately cleared <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=54>Seacrest</span> in the eyes of the network) and ABC are standing behind <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=55>Seacrest</span>, as is the 43-year-old’s Live with Kelly and Ryan co-host, Kelly <span data-scayt_word=Ripa data-scaytid=58>Ripa</span>, who made a point to defend him on air. “I know what an easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day. And we all do, we all do,” she said.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>When <span data-scayt_word="Seacrest's" data-scaytid=60>Seacrest’s</span> accuser resurfaced the claims this month, ultimately calling the investigation insufficient, <span data-scayt_word=Seacrest data-scaytid=61>Seacrest</span> reiterated his innocence in a statement: “This person who has accused me of horrible things offered, on multiple occasions, to withdraw her claims if I paid her millions of dollars. I refused. I have worked extremely hard to achieve my success and I don’t take my opportunities for granted. I don’t want to accuse anyone of not telling the truth but in this case, I have no choice but to again deny the claims against me, remind people that I was recused of any wrongdoing, and put the matter to rest.”</p><p>Moving forward, Jones says that the host should “concentrate on what he can control,” adding that the situation is<i>&nbsp;“</i>absolutely recoverable.”&nbsp; She adds, “Eventually, this too will pass.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSrbClnV%2Bstq24jKuwmqZdqLKir9Geqq2rXZi5sMDHoqWgZaOgtq%2BvwKucZqSZo7K0edKunZ%2BdomLEorfEZqqesKWWuW65yKyaqKaUqrC1edKcmKeckaF6cnyYa21wcV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-ryan-seacrest-s-clothing-and-skincare-lines-suffer-in-the-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwill-ryan-seacrest-s-clothing-and-skincare-lines-suffer-in-the-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-scandal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwill-ryan-seacrest-s-clothing-and-skincare-lines-suffer-in-the-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwill-ryan-seacrest-s-clothing-and-skincare-lines-suffer-in-the-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-ryan-seacrest-s-clothing-and-skincare-lines-suffer-in-the-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-ryan-seacrest-s-clothing-and-skincare-lines-suffer-in-the-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./willie-adler-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./willie-adler-net-worth.html>Willie Adler Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-you-won-t-see-luke-gulbranson-on-summer-house-anymore.html>Why You Won't See Luke Gulbranson On Summer House Anymore</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-you-won-t-see-luke-gulbranson-on-summer-house-anymore.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
