<time>04 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Justin Bartha is a film, television and stage actor with several notable acting credits.&nbsp;He is best known for his role as Riley Poole in the highly successful&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure</span></i><span>&nbsp;film series.&nbsp;He also appeared as Doug Billings in another box office hit,&nbsp;</span><span>The Hangover</span><span>&nbsp;Trilogy.</span></p><p><span>Bartha has recorded several credits on the small screen, including the sitcom&nbsp;</span><i><span>Teacher</span></i><span>&nbsp;and the comedy series&nbsp;</span><i><span>The New Normal</span></i><span>&nbsp;both on NBC.&nbsp;In 2017, the talented actor was cast in the role of Colin Morrello in the web series&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Good Fight</span></i><span></span></p><h2><strong><span>Justin Bartha biography, dude</span></strong></h2><p><span>Justin Lee Bartha was born on July 21, 1978 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.&nbsp;His parents are Stephen, a real estate developer, and Betty, a school teacher.&nbsp;He has one sibling, an older brother named Jeffrey.&nbsp;The family moved to West Bloomfield, Michigan when he was eight and he attended West Bloomfield High School there.&nbsp;He graduated from high school in 1966, after which he moved to New York City.&nbsp;For college, he attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, where he majored in film and drama.</span></p><p><span>Justin Bartha credited his acting debut as an uncredited extra in the drama film&nbsp;</span><i><span>54</span></i><span>&nbsp;(1998).&nbsp;He also took some time away from acting to play some behind-the-scenes roles afterwards.&nbsp;He worked as a production assistant on the 1999 film&nbsp;</span><i><span>Analyze the</span></i><span>&nbsp;Afterward, wrote, produced and directed the short film&nbsp;</span><i><span>High and Low</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2003).&nbsp;He wrote, produced and starred in an MTV pilot&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Dustin and Justin Show.</span></i></p><p><span>Bartha returned to screens with roles in the short&nbsp;</span><i><span>Carnival Sun</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2002) as well as the star-studded romantic comedy&nbsp;</span><i><span>Gigli</span></i><i>&nbsp;</i><span>(2003), opposite Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.&nbsp;In 2004, he appeared as Riley Poole in the action-adventure film&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure</span></i><span>&nbsp;which was a box office hit.&nbsp;The talented actor enjoyed further box office success with roles in&nbsp;</span><i><span>Mistakes Starting</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2006) and&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure: Book of Secrets</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2007), a sequel to&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure</span></i><span></span></p><p><span>The talented movie star struck gold again when he starred in the comedy film&nbsp;</span><i><span class=vcard><span class=fn><span>The Hangover</span></span></span></i><span>&nbsp;(2009) with Doug Billings.&nbsp;He also starred in the romantic comedy&nbsp;</span><span>The Rebound</span><span>&nbsp;(2009) opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones, followed by roles in&nbsp;</span><i><span>Sacred Roles</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2010) and&nbsp;</span><i><span>Dark Horse</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2011).</span></p><p><span>Justin Bartha reprized his role as Doug Billings in the second and third installments of&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Hangover</span></i><span>&nbsp;Trilogy;&nbsp;</span><span>The Hangover Part II</span><span>&nbsp;(2011) and&nbsp;</span><i><span class=vcard><span class=fn><span>The Hangover Part III</span></span></span></i><span>&nbsp;(2013) were both very successful.&nbsp;After the success of the&nbsp;</span><span>Hangover</span><span>&nbsp;films at the box office, Bartha has also appeared in other films such as&nbsp;</span><i><span>CBGB</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2013),&nbsp;</span><i><span>White Girl</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2016) and&nbsp;</span><span>Sticky Notes</span><span>&nbsp;(2016).</span></p><p><span>Similarly, Justin Bartha’s television credits are as impressive as his film credits.&nbsp;His minor film debut came in 2004 with a small role in the TV movie The&nbsp;</span><span>Strip Search</span><span>&nbsp;This was followed by starring roles in the short-lived sitcom&nbsp;</span><i><span>Teacher</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2006) and the mini -series&nbsp;</span><i><span>World War II in HD</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2009).&nbsp;Bartha was the lead actor in the sitcom&nbsp;</span><i><span>The New Normal</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2012-2013) starred as David Sawyer and he was also in the main cast of another sitcom&nbsp;</span><span>Cooper Barrett’s Guide to Survival</span><span>&nbsp;(2016).&nbsp;In November 2016, the talented actor was cast as Colin Morrello in the political drama series&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Good Fight</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2017-Present).</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Justin Bartha has steadily risen in Hollywood’s career since his professional acting debut in 1998. The talented actor has also had his fair share of big-budget box office hits throughout his career, including the&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure</span></i><span>&nbsp;film series and&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Hangover</span></i><span>&nbsp;Trilogy.&nbsp;Thanks to his burgeoning career in Hollywood and a few other business ventures, the actor was able to earn an enviable net worth of $22 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Justin Bartha’s wife is none other than fitness instructor Lia Smith.&nbsp;It remains uncertain when this couple first got together.&nbsp;However, their romance became public in January 2013 when they were photographed while vacationing in Hawaii.&nbsp;Things progressed quite quickly between the two lovebirds when they announced their engagement until May 2013.</span></p><p><span>Justin Bartha and his leading lady, Lia Smith, finally tied the knot on January 4, 2014 in Smith’s hometown of Oahu, Hawaii.&nbsp;Soon after their marriage, on April 13, 2014, they welcomed their first child, a daughter named Asa Charlotte.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Justin Bartha gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Prior to his marriage to Lia Smith, JustinBartha was involved in a number of high-profile relationships, all involving people of the opposite sex.&nbsp;He had arranged to meet model and actress Stephanie Sieber and Ashley Olsen, who had become a fashion designer.&nbsp;Bartha was equally linked to superstar actress Scarlett Johansson.</span></p><p><span>It’s pretty obvious that this Hollywood actor has a thing for women who follow up on his dating history.&nbsp;Of course he portrayed a gay character in the series&nbsp;</span><i><span>The New Normal</span></i><span>, but all of that was make-believe and totally different from the actor’s reality.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and other body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>Justin Bartha is 173 cm tall and he weighs 69 kg.&nbsp;His chest measurement is 43 inches (109 cm) while his biceps and waist measurements are 15 inches (38 cm) and 35 inches (89 cm) respectively.</span></p><p class=postsid
