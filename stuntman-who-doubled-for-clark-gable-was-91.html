Young, a Navy frogman turned stuntman who stood in for Richard Widmark in&nbsp;Slattery’s Hurricane, for Rock Hudson in Winchester ’73&nbsp;and for look-alike Clark Gable in the legendary actor’s final film,&nbsp;The Misfits, has died. He was 91.</p><p>Young died Sept. 12 in Tucson, Arizona, his son, University of Arizona film professor Cody Young, told&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Young also doubled for Edmond O’Brien in&nbsp;D.O.A.&nbsp;(1949), and his résumé as a stuntman includes the <a href=# id=auto-tag_john-wayne data-tag=john-wayne>John Wayne</a> films&nbsp;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&nbsp;(1949),&nbsp;Rio Grande&nbsp;(1950),&nbsp;Hondo&nbsp;(1953),&nbsp;The Searchers&nbsp;(1956),&nbsp;The Alamo&nbsp;(1959) and&nbsp;McLintock! (1963); the Gary Cooper classic&nbsp;High Noon&nbsp;(1952); and&nbsp;Creature From the Black Lagoon&nbsp;(1954).</p><p>In&nbsp;Rio Bravo&nbsp;(1959), filmed at the famed Old Tucson studios, the guy Young is playing gets shot by Dean Martin’s Dude in a saloon and tumbles out of a loft. And during a shootout at the end of the movie, he is shot after emerging from a barn that is then blown up.</p><p>An expert horseman who played the harmonica and went by the nickname “Black Jack,” Young appeared frequently in movies shot at Old Tucson — known as “Hollywood in the Desert” — and later did casting and served as a production manager, location scout and industry go-to guy in Southern Arizona.</p><p>He was quite busy as a stuntman in the 1950s.</p><p>“We would start one of those movies on Monday, finish on Wednesday, start another one on Wednesday and finish on Friday,” Young <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> the&nbsp;Tucson Weekly&nbsp;in 2001. “It was truly Hollywood in those days. I was having a ball playing cowboy and making big money.”</p><p>On&nbsp;The Alamo, Young lost control of his horse during a scene that featured more than a dozen horses and riders and was nearly trampled to death when his body resembled a “rag doll.” He fractured his skull, punctured his lung and broke several bones, spending 17 days in a coma and six months in the hospital.</p><p>Still, Young continued to perform, even after he watched a fellow stuntman lose his leg while filming a train robbery in&nbsp;How the West Was Won&nbsp;(1962).</p><p>Born on Sept. 25, 1926, in Fincastle, Virginia, and raised on a farm, Young “didn’t take to schooling,” his son said. With an eighth-grade education, he joined the U.S. Navy when he was 15 and became an Underwater Demolitions Team frogman, surviving more than 100 missions during World War II.</p><p>After the service, Young came to Hollywood and worked as an extra for $2 a day. When he heard Fox was having trouble making a movie that contained several water scenes, he drove to the lot and got hired as an underwater stunt consultant.&nbsp;</p><p>In one of his first jobs as a Western stuntman, Young was asked to fall off a horse. “The plan was simple: fall off and land in the sand pit,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>recalled</a> in a 2012 interview. “I managed one out of two. I missed the sand by 30 feet and bounced like a rubber ball. I jumped up and asked if they wanted me to do it again.”</p><p>He said he learned how to do stunts from Chuck Roberson, who at 6-foot-5 would become Wayne’s personal double.</p><p>Young got his SAG card for working on&nbsp;The Street With No Name&nbsp;(1948) and put his Navy skills to use in&nbsp;The Frogman&nbsp;(1951). Both of those films starred Widmark, and he would work in many of the actor’s movies, including&nbsp;Slattery’s Hurricane&nbsp;(1949), Panic in the Streets&nbsp;(1950),&nbsp;The Law and Jake Wade&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;The Alamo&nbsp;and&nbsp;How the West Was Won.</p><p>Though he said he respected Widmark’s skills as an actor, “I never cared for him very much,” Young wrote in an unpublished memoir. “He always seemed to be a little standoffish, didn’t like the crewmembers, and whined a lot.”</p><p>He did, however, think a great deal of Jimmy Stewart; they were together on such films as&nbsp;Winchester ’73&nbsp;(1950) — where Young appeared as Native Americans —&nbsp;The Naked Spur&nbsp;(1953),&nbsp;The Far Country&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;The Man From Laramie&nbsp;(1955) and&nbsp;The Cheyenne Social Club&nbsp;(1970).</p><p>“Jimmy was a great guy and really treated everyone well,” he wrote. “He loved the stuntmen and liked to hang out when he could.”</p><p>Young worked with Gable in&nbsp;Across the Wide Missouri&nbsp;(1951),&nbsp;Lone Star&nbsp;(1952),&nbsp;The Tall Men&nbsp;(1955),&nbsp;The King and Four Queens&nbsp;(1956) and, most famously, on John Huston’s&nbsp;The Misfits&nbsp;(1961).&nbsp;</p><p>While employed on&nbsp;McLintock!&nbsp;at Old Tucson, Young met Bob Shelton, the founder of the studio, who later hired Young as a gunfighter as part of a stunt show for tourists. In 1972, he launched his own company, Young Film Productions.</p><p>In addition to Cody, survivors include another son, John, and daughters Melanie and Teresa.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKutwqRkp2WppMKvs4ydnJqcXajBtrrTppinZaedvG6wzq6ZpZ2UYrCtrdGkZKCZkqGybsPArGRyaV1mfnWBlHBqaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstuntman-who-doubled-for-clark-gable-was-91.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstuntman-who-doubled-for-clark-gable-was-91.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstuntman-who-doubled-for-clark-gable-was-91.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstuntman-who-doubled-for-clark-gable-was-91.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstuntman-who-doubled-for-clark-gable-was-91.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstuntman-who-doubled-for-clark-gable-was-91.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./summer-rayne-oakes-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./summer-rayne-oakes-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>Summer Rayne Oakes Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stream-women-s-basketball-online-free.html>Stream Women's Basketball Online Free</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stream-women-s-basketball-online-free.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
