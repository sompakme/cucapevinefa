He took $20 from one son for getting a D on a math test and he gave another son an extra $35 for doing extra chores. Combined, the sons had $81. Figure out how much each son had. Let x, y, and z be the money each son received. To begin, x = y = z. But then, Dad took 20 from son X and gave it to son Y. So now, x = y - 20 Next, he gave Son Z an extra $35 for chores So z is now y + 35 since y and z used to be equal Combined, they all have 81. x + y + z = 181 But with the changes, it is: (y - 20) + y + (y + 35) Combine like terms: 3y - 20 + 35 = 81 3y + 15 = 81 Subtract 15 from each side: 3y = 66 Divide each side by 3 to isolate y y = 22 Since x = y - 20, x = 2 Since z = y + 35, we have z = 57 Checking our work, 2 + 22 + 57 = 81.<br></p><a href=# title="Click to jump to A financial analyst computed the ROI for all companies listed on the NYSE.
