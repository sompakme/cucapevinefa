This prevents unnecessary battery drain, as a fully charged battery can hold its charge for 6-12 months if you do this.<h2>Why do you connect the positive terminal first?</h2>Connect positive first, negative having less potential won't arc. The higher the voltage, the greater the chance of arcing and fusion. On a car if negative first and you are touching any metal part of car, when attaching positive there is possibility of arcing through you. Your body becomes part of the circuit.<h2>Why don't you connect the negative when jumping a car?</h2>Quick Tips: Jumping a Battery<p>Never connect the black cable to the negative (–) terminal on your dead battery. This is very dangerous, as it could result in an explosion.</p><h2>Do you connect black or red first when jumping a car?</h2>Attach the red jumper cables first. Start by clamping one red cable to the positive side of the battery that won't start. Then attach the other red clamp to the positive side of the working battery. Next, clamp one black cable to the negative side of the working battery.<h2>Why is the negative terminal connected to the body of the car?</h2>The negative terminal of the devices are then connected to the chassis thus completing a loop for the current flow. This way wires required is minimized and wiring is less complicated. Since the negative terminal is connected to the chassis, it is at zero potential and hence passengers will NOT be electrocuted.<h2>Is it OK to just disconnect the positive terminal?</h2>Be safe: always disconnect negative first. Disconnected either terminal will prevent drain, as stated already. A battery tender is another safe way to maintain the battery.<h2>What happens if you disconnect the battery while the car is still running?</h2>Removing the battery from the circuit allows those spikes and transients to travel around, endangering every semiconductor circuit in your car. The ECU, the speed sensitive steering, the memory seat adjustments, the cruise control, and even the car's stereo.<h2>When a battery is disconnected the earth lead should always be disconnected first because?</h2>Because the negative end of the battery is connected to ground.

That'll preserve the battery's charge, so when you reconnect it, the truck should start right up.<h2>Do I disconnect the positive or negative to check the alternator?</h2>You can check the alternator by simply starting your car and then disconnecting the negative battery cable. Be careful doing this, though, because there are a lot of moving parts in your engine compartment that could cause injury.<h2>Is it safe to touch the positive terminal of a car battery?</h2>Tom: The danger from car batteries is not so much electrocution as it is explosion. If you touch both terminals with a metal wrench, for instance, you can create a spark that can ignite hydrogen gas in the battery. That can send pieces of battery and acid flying.<h2>Does revving engine charge battery faster?</h2>The battery will charge faster if you rev the engine faster. Why? Because the faster the crankshaft turns, the faster it turns the belt that runs the alternator. And the faster the alternator turns, the more electricity it produces to run all the electrical stuff in the car — and recharge the battery.<h2>How long does it take an alternator to charge a battery while driving?</h2>A car's alternator is responsible for charging and maintaining the power in the car's battery. While you are driving, the alternator will spin faster and generate more power. It will usually take a car battery between thirty minutes and one hour to completely charge while driving.<h2>How often should I start my car to keep the battery charged?</h2>The easiest thing you can do to prevent your car battery from dying is to start your car once a week and letting it run anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. You can even take it for a drive around the block, which should provide just enough power to recharge the battery and keep it alive for another week or so.<h2>Is it safe to leave a car battery charging overnight?</h2>It is essential to read the instructions with the battery charger to determine whether it is safe to leave it on overnight. However, it is generally recommended not to leave a battery charger on without care for more than eight hours, as this can cause overheating, damage to the unit, or even fire.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahsGarmKTCrbCMsqauZZSewKS7zaecnKxdqbWmec2enpqsmauybq7Araueqqliwaa%2BzKKlmqRdm7azv9M%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-should-you-disconnect-the-negative-battery-terminal-first.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-should-you-disconnect-the-negative-battery-terminal-first.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-should-you-disconnect-the-negative-battery-terminal-first.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-should-you-disconnect-the-negative-battery-terminal-first.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-should-you-disconnect-the-negative-battery-terminal-first.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-should-you-disconnect-the-negative-battery-terminal-first.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./william-powell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./william-powell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>William Powell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-does-a-csf-leak-feel-like.html>What does a CSF leak feel like?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-does-a-csf-leak-feel-like.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
