Fans are also probably familiar with the superstar singer's love life, thanks to her very public relationships — including one&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>involving comedian Pete Davidson</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That familiarity (she did write a song called "Pete Davidson," after all) could be why her whirlwind romance with real estate broker Dalton Gomez seemed to come out of nowhere, just like their surprise wedding back in 2021. Grande once told followers during a&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2022 TikTok makeup tutorial</a>, "I'm not getting a divorce. Before you start, don't." However, she and Gomez ultimately parted ways — two years after she walked down the aisle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of trying to decipher their relationship through the This Is Ariana Grande Spotify playlist, we did the research for you to come up with everything you need to know about the couple, from their first kiss to that picture-perfect wedding and their unexpected divorce.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez's relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2019-2020-ariana-grande-and-dalton-gomez-first-meet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2019-2020: Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez first meet</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the pandemic hit, "Ariana was looking for a home outside of Los Angeles to be her getaway house, and her team found Dalton to help," a source&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;Us Weekly</a>. "When she saw him, she immediately thought he was cute and very good-looking, and she asked her team to set up an in-person meeting with him. Ariana fell very hard for Dalton shortly after they met."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-2020-ariana-grande-and-dalton-gomez-are-first-spotted-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 2020: Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez are first spotted together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to&nbsp;Us, Grande and Gomez reportedly started dating at the beginning of 2020. Instead of a headline-grabbing love affair, the "7 rings" singer kept this relationship out of the spotlight, especially after she ended her engagement to Davidson in October 2018. Still, that didn't prevent&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>&nbsp;paparazzi from snapping a few shots of Grande kissing someone the outlet dubbed a "mystery man," adding that he "might not even be all that famous" because he wasn't "instantly recognizable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, fans connected a few dots and found that Grande and her friends were following Gomez and his brother, Dakota, on Instagram. The news came after rumors that he joined the close-knit group of friends for a game night on February 22.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They have been hanging out for a couple of months," a source <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told People</a>. "Ariana doesn't want to do another public relationship, so she is trying to keep this one quiet, but she seems very happy with Dalton."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-march-2020-ariana-grande-and-dalton-gomez-go-into-lockdown-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>March 2020: Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez go into lockdown together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like the rest of the world, Grande goes into lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"One of the people she is with right now is Dalton."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eagle-eyed fans spotted him in one of Grande's Instagram Stories, thanks to his distinct tattoos. As the month came to a close, Grande posted a preview of a song to Instagram, and many presumed that she was addressing her relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lyrics go like this: "You got me all up in my feels / In all kind of ways / I be tryna wait but lately, I just wanna keep it real / No more playin' safe / Let's take it all the way."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-may-8-2020-ariana-grandes-stuck-with-u-music-video-features-a-cameo-by-dalton-gomez></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>May 8, 2020: Ariana Grande's "Stuck With U" music video features a cameo by Dalton Gomez</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not his arm in a Story counts as going Instagram official, Gomez makes a full-on cameo in Grande's music video for "Stuck With U," her duet with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Justin Bieber.</a>&nbsp;Grande and Gomez can be seen slow-dancing and hugging in the clip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the video premiered, the two were seen at a&nbsp;Black Lives Matter&nbsp;protest in Los Angeles,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>reported Insider</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-june-25-2020-ariana-grande-and-dalton-gomez-go-instagram-official></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>June 25, 2020: Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez go Instagram official</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>@arianagrande / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Th pair went Instagram official in the summer when Gomez made a proper appearance on her feed in a since-deleted post.
