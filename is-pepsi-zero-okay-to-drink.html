But just because these sodas have low or no sugar or calories, that doesn't make them technically healthier than regular soft drinks.<h2>Does Pepsi Zero make you gain weight?</h2>Diet sodas have zero calories. So it seems logical that replacing one with the other should help you lose weight, or at least stay the same weight. But no--several studies have proved conclusively that drinking diet soda is associated with weight gain.<h2>Is Pepsi zero worse than Diet Pepsi?</h2>Pepsi Zero Sugar contains 69 milligrams of caffeine per 355ml (12 fl oz), versus 36 milligrams in Diet Pepsi.<h2>What is the healthiest diet soda to drink?</h2><p>11 Best Sugar-Free Sodas on Grocery Store Shelves</p><ul><li>Zevia Zero Calorie Soda, Cola.</li><li>Virgil's Zero Sugar Root Beer.</li><li>Reed's Zero Sugar Real Ginger Ale.</li><li>Bubly Sparkling Water, Cherry.</li><li>Spindrift Lemon Sparkling Water.</li><li>Poland Spring Sparkling Water, Lemon Lime.</li><li>LaCroix.</li><li>Perrier.</li></ul><h2>Diet Soda vs Regular Soda | Which is Better For You?</h2><p></p><h2>What soda is healthiest?</h2>Sierra Mist<p>As it turns out, it certainly wins in terms of healthiness.

There's a chance these substances could be causing metabolic changes that increase — rather than decrease — your risk of obesity and serious diseases.<h2>Is cola Zero better than regular cola?</h2>There are very few differences between Diet Coke and Coke Zero. As such, there is no concrete, measurable reason to suggest that one is superior to the other. Nutritionally, there are no significant differences. Their ingredient and caffeine contents are similar as well, so neither is healthier than the other.<h2>What is the sweetener in Pepsi Zero?</h2>It is designed to taste more like regular Pepsi than Diet Pepsi by using the sweeteners Aspartame and Ace-k. This USA drink contains significantly more caffeine than regular Pepsi and has added ginseng. It is a competitor to Coca Cola's Coke Zero.<h2>Why you shouldn't drink diet soda?</h2>Although diet soda has no calories, sugar, or fat, it has been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in several studies. Research has found that just one serving of an artificially sweetened drink per day is associated with an 8–13% higher risk of type 2 diabetes ( 22 , 23 ).<h2>Is Pepsi zero good for diabetics?</h2>For most people living with diabetes, sugar-free sodas are safe in moderation. Resist the urge to pair something sweet or high in calories with that no-calorie beverage.<h2>What happens if I drink Coke Zero everyday?</h2>Coke Zero and other diet sodas are linked to alterations in the gut microbiome and an increased risk of osteoporosis and heart and kidney disease.<h2>Why is there no Diet Pepsi in stores 2021?</h2>That's because some diet sodas are disappearing — or at least, that packaging is gone. Instead you'll find those beverages under their new branding: zero sugar. "Zero sugar" has replaced "diet" for many no-calorie soft drinks.<h2>What happens if I drink Pepsi everyday?</h2>Drinking soda every day, whether regular or diet, is associated with increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, weight gain and all-cause mortality. It can also negatively affect your bones, teeth and liver.<h2>How is Diet Pepsi 0 calories?</h2>Diet soda is a zero-calorie, sugar-free version of a carbonated beverages. For example: to give the diet soda its classic sweet taste, Diet Coke contains aspartame and Splenda, both of which are artificial sweeteners, which contain no actual sugar or calories.<h2>Does Pepsi Zero really have no calories?</h2>Yes. We sweeten Coke Zero Sugar in our bottles and cans with a blend of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (or Ace-K). Together, they create a great taste with zero sugar and zero calories.<h2>Why Does Diet Pepsi have aspartame again?</h2>PepsiCo is adding aspartame back to its flagship Diet Pepsi product. The company pulled the controversial ingredient in 2015, but brought it back in limited quantities a year later after backlash from brand loyalists. The aspartame-free version will still be available, but only via e-commerce.<h2>What's the unhealthiest soda?</h2><p>According to a recent story by The Daily Meal, the top five unhealthiest — based on caloric, sodium, carbohydrate, and sugar content — are:</p><ul><li>Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash.</li><li>Wild Cherry Pepsi.</li><li>Fanta Orange.</li><li>Mountain Dew.</li><li>Mellow Yellow.</li></ul><h2>Is Pepsi healthier than Coke?</h2>Her verdict on Coke vs. Pepsi is that neither one is better for you, as both have "poor health implications."
